# BeAware Mobile App

A new Flutter mobile app destined for street safety.

## Project Description

  The BeAware mobile application was developed using the Flutter framework, the Android Sudio IDE and the Firebase database, namely Firestore.
  
  The BeAware Mobile Application aims to increase safety in urban environments by encouraging user participation and real-time information exchange. By providing users with a platform to mark the points on the map, the application encourages community vigilance by drawing attention to potentially dangerous regions. It is easy for users to indicate risky locations, such as poorly lit streets, regions with high levels of crime or places with dangerous circumstances. By identifying these sites, users can work together to raise awareness and encourage others to be cautious. Users are free to check their list of markings and to remove them, if necessary. Reflecting the changing nature of the urban environment, this feature ensures that information is relevant and relevant.

  The essential characteristic of this application is the “SOS ” functionality. When the user is in an uncertain situation, he can convey a predefined message to his emergency contacts within the application, which contains a Google Maps link to his exact location.
  
	The purpose of the application is to create a safer environment for all users, based on constant and up-to-date transmission of information. The app uses the accessibility of mobile phones and digital maps to promote community involvement and foster a shared sense of responsibility for urban safety. By using this application, users can actively contribute to the overall safety of their environment, while having quick access to help when needed.

   With regard to the development of the application, as well as future directions, a functionality that can make its users more efficient and reliable is the input of a shortcut for the "SOS" button in cases where the use of the telon is not accessible at the time. Another functionality would be the introduction of notifications from the application to its users when a new marking was recently indicated in their surroundings.
